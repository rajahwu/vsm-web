## Readiness Criteria

- [ ] Reports are stored only in `RDX/reports/`.
- [ ] Plans live in `RDX/plans/` and are referenced by TODOs.
- [ ] TODOs are maintained only under `RDX/todos/`.
- [ ] Root README points to the RDX TODO index.
- [ ] Legacy TODO/report locations contain stub links to RDX.

## Standard Report Naming Convention

Use the following format for new reports:

`YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_<author>_<report-type>_<title>.md`

**Report Types (standardized):**
- `audit`
- `completion`
- `migration`
- `integration`
- `build-fix`
- `refactor`
- `analysis`

**Example:**
`2025-12-19_0256_codex_migration_rdx-directory-audit.md`
