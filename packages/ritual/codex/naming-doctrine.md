# Naming Doctrine

## Purpose
This doctrine defines the **canonical language** of the VSM School system.

Names are not aesthetic.  
Names are **constraints on behavior**.

If a term causes confusion about *what to do next*, it is incorrect.

## Canonical Terms

### Codex
**Role:** Doctrine, definitions, reference

- Read-only
- Non-blocking
- Optional during sessions
- Never time-bound

> Codex explains. It does not execute.

---

### Pulse
**Role:** Temporal rhythm

- Sets session duration
- Governs phase timing
- Visible throughout a session

> Pulse controls time, not behavior.

---

### Track
**Role:** Doctrine container

- A literacy domain
- Linear sequence of Cards
- Progress measured as literacy

> A Track is a syllabus, not a menu.

---

### Card
**Role:** Instructional atom

- One skill
- One execution loop
- One archived output

> A Card is the unit of mastery.

---

### Prime
**Role:** State alignment before work

- Short
- Mechanical
- Timed
- No reflection
- No creativity

> Prime prepares the operator.  
> Prime does not produce artifacts.

---

### Produce
**Role:** Execution phase

- Output-focused
- Time-aware
- Value-creating

> Produce is where work happens.

---

### Work Surface
**Role:** Execution environment

- Distraction-free
- Tool-agnostic
- Hosts Produce

> All production occurs on the Work Surface.

---

### Archive
**Role:** Persistence and record

- Immutable

### Review
**Role:** Meta-learning
