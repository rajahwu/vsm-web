# Genesis — The Alphabet

Genesis defines the **visual primitives** used throughout VSM School.

These are not metaphors.  
They are structural symbols.

## Cards

1. **The Dot** — Actor / Source  
2. **The Rectangle** — Process / Time  
3. **The Diamond** — Decision / Gate  
4. **The Arrow** — Cause / Flow

## Outcome

A user fluent in Genesis can:

- Identify actors before work begins
- Separate action from decision
- Trace cause without narrative

Genesis literacy is required before all other Tracks.
