# VSM School Codex

The Codex is the doctrinal reference layer of VSM School. It contains the definitions, principles, and operational knowledge for visual systems modeling.

## Purpose

The Codex is **read-only**. It never initiates sessions, never tracks progress, and closes during execution phases (Prime and Produce).

**Core Rule:** If the user is acting, Codex is closed. If the user is reading, time is stopped.

## Three Tracks

### Genesis: The Alphabet
Pre-literate visual primitives for reasoning about systems.

**Cards:**
- [The Dot](genesis/dot.md) — Single actor, location, or data source
- [The Rectangle](genesis/rectangle.md) — Process step that consumes time
- [The Diamond](genesis/diamond.md) — Decision gate (yes/no resolution)
- [The Arrow](genesis/arrow.md) — Causality and sequence

### Source Code: The Doctrine
Sentence-level system reasoning built from Genesis primitives.

**Cards:**
- [Logic Flow](source-code/logic-flow.md) — Ordered movement from start to end
- [Swimlane](source-code/swimlane.md) — Ownership assignment to process steps
- [Feedback Loop](source-code/feedback-loop.md) — Corrective cycles for system learning

### Powerhouse: Execution & Dexterity
Cognitive and physical alignment under load.

**Cards:**
- [Dexterity](powerhouse/dexterity.md) — Physical control and precision
- [High Ground](powerhouse/high-ground.md) — Positional advantage and clarity
- [Interlock](powerhouse/interlock.md) — Structural cohesion
- [Hidden Move](powerhouse/hidden-move.md) — Strategic asset multiplication

## Navigation

Each card includes:
- **Definition** — What it is
- **Function** — What question it answers
- **Operational Use** — When and how to apply it
- **Failure Mode** — What happens when it's missing
- **Related Cards** — Conceptual connections

## Progression

Master the Alphabet before writing Poetry. Complete Genesis before advancing to Source Code. Complete Source Code before attempting Powerhouse.

The primitives are the foundation. The doctrine is the structure. The powerhouse is the execution.
