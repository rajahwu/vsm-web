# Interlock

## Definition
Interlock is structural cohesion—the integration of components so tightly that removing one piece causes the whole to fail.

## Function
It answers: *What must hold together?*

Interlock transforms collections of parts into unified systems. It's the difference between a pile of bricks and an arch.

## Operational Use
- Before/After transformation narratives
- Multi-stakeholder dependency mapping
- Integration testing across system boundaries
- Story-data coherence in client deliverables
- Ensuring visual diagrams match written documentation

Map the transformations first. Then lock the dependencies.

## Failure Mode
Loose systems fail under load.

When components aren't interlocked, pressure causes separation. Diagrams contradict documentation. Features ship without supporting infrastructure. The narrative collapses on first contact.
