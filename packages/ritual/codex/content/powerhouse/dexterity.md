# Dexterity

## Definition
Dexterity is the physical coordination between hands and mind that enables execution under load.

## Function
It answers: *Can I control my instruments when pressure arrives?*

## Operational Use
- Card handling and palm control
- Smooth transitions between states
- Maintaining flow during complex sequences
- Physical confidence under observation
- Muscle memory development

Practice dexterity daily in controlled environments before attempting performance.

## Failure Mode
Without dexterity, ideas remain theoretical and execution becomes hesitant.

When hands freeze, trust vanishes.
