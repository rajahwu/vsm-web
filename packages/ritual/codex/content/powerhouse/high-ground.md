# High Ground

## Definition
High Ground is positional advantage—the perspective from which patterns become visible and strategy becomes possible.

## Function
It answers: *Where should I stand to see clearly?*

Taking the high ground means stepping back from execution to observe the entire field: competing priorities, resource constraints, and second-order consequences.

## Operational Use
- Strategic planning sessions (quarterly reviews, roadmap design)
- Stakeholder alignment before major initiatives
- Crisis response coordination
- Portfolio management across multiple projects
- Pre-mortem analysis: "If this fails, what will the cause have been?"

Claim the high ground before committing resources to the ground war.

## Failure Mode
Low ground decisions are reactive and narrow.

When you operate at ground level only, urgency masks importance, tactics replace strategy, and you fight the wrong battles efficiently.
