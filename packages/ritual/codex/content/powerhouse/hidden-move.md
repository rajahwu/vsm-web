# Hidden Move

## Definition
The Hidden Move is the strategic act of making one core asset appear as many, multiplying impact through deliberate reformatting.

## Function
It answers: *How do I make this scale?*

The hidden move isn't deception—it's transformation. One insight becomes a tweet, a diagram, a CLI command, and a case study. Same core, different surfaces.

## Operational Use
- Content atomization and reformatting
- Cross-platform presence from single source material
- Repurposing client deliverables for portfolio work
- Modular system design (one component, many implementations)
- "Splintering" one idea into multiple assets

Execute the hidden move when you understand the core deeply enough to reframe it infinitely.

## Failure Mode
Correct action at the wrong time still fails.

Premature scaling creates shallow copies. Late scaling wastes momentum. The hidden move requires both timing and craft—empathy for the audience and control of the instrument.
