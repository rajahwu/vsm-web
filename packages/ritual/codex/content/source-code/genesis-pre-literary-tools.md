The Pre-Literary tools, or genesis tools, we need...

Based on the **Systems-Work Workbook** and **Comprehensive Guide to Diagrams** you provided, the "Pre-Literary" tools (or Genesis Tools) are the raw visual primitives—the "vocabulary" you must master before you can write "sentences" (complex diagrams)1111.

These are the atomic elements of your VSM training. You cannot build a system if you cannot draw a box.

Here is the breakdown of the **Pre-Literary Tools** and the related **Foundational Tools** across your doctrine.

### **1\. The Genesis Tools (Pre-Literary Primitives)**

These are the visual building blocks that give diagrams their expressive power2. In VSM training, these are the "Physical Skills" for your hands.

* **Points (Dots):**  
  * **Definition:** The most primitive element, denoting a single location or entity in space3.

  * **Usage:** Marks actors, critical events, decision points, or reference locations4.

* **Lines:**  
  * **Definition:** Connectors that represent relationships or flows5.

  * **Nuance:** The style (dashed, bold, curved) is a design decision that carries specific information (e.g., strong vs. weak influence)6.

* **Shapes (The Syntax):**  
  * **Rectangle/Square:** The standard symbol for process steps, tasks, or actors (used heavily in flowcharts and swimlanes)7.

  * **Circle/Oval:** Suggests wholeness, cyclic processes, or feedback loops; also used for "Start/End" points8888.

  * **Diamond:** The specific symbol for **Decision Points** (forks in the logic)9.

  * **Triangle:** Symbolizes hierarchy, directionality, or convergence10.

* **Arrows:**  
  * **Definition:** The communicators of **Direction**11.

  * **Usage:** They signify flows of influence, causation, control, or sequence12.

* **Space & Alignment:**  
  * **Definition:** The use of negative space and grids13.

  * **Usage:** Using layout to support hierarchical grouping or logical sequencing14.

### **2\. Related Foundational Tools ("Like Tools")**

Once you master the Genesis Tools (dots/lines), you apply them to specific "Fields" of thought. These are the tools that govern the VSM logic.

#### **A. Systems Thinking Tools (Structure)**

* **Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs):** Tools to visualize feedback structures (reinforcing or balancing) within complex systems15.

* **Stock & Flow Diagrams:** Tools to highlight accumulations (backlogs/inventory) and their rates of change16161616.

* **Iceberg Model:** A mental model tool to connect visible events to underlying patterns and structures17.

#### **B. DesignOps Tools (Process)**

* **Swimlane Diagrams:** Tools that organize workflows by dividing steps into parallel lanes to track responsibility and handoffs18.

* **Handoff Protocols:** Documentation ensuring seamless transfer of assets with clear specs19.

* **Checklists & Templates:** Standardized tools for sprint planning and reviews20.

#### **C. Information Design Tools (Communication)**

* **Journey Mapping:** Visualizing steps, touchpoints, and emotions across time21212121.

* **Hierarchy & Emphasis:** Using visual weight (bolding, size) to guide the viewer’s eye22.

* **Infographics:** Combining data and illustration to narrate a story23.

#### **D. Organizational Learning Tools (Adaptation)**

* **After-Action Reviews (AARs):** Structured debriefs to analyze what happened versus what was intended24.

* **Double-Loop Learning:** A method for challenging underlying assumptions, not just correcting errors25.

### **3\. Training Protocol: From Genesis to Mastery**

To train these tools, your manual suggests a specific progression of practice:

1. **Daily 10-Minute Map:** Sketch one system you touched today using *only* boxes and arrows (Genesis Tools)26.

2. **Sketching Technique:**  
   * **Start Simple:** Use rough pencil sketches or whiteboard work first27.

   * **One-Layer Rule:** If it feels foggy, make a one-layer diagram (actors \+ steps) first28.

   * **Test for Clarity:** Can someone unfamiliar with the system interpret your diagram?29.

This hierarchy—**Pre-Literary Primitives $\\rightarrow$ Diagram Types $\\rightarrow$ Integrated Practice**—is the core of your VSM training doctrine.
