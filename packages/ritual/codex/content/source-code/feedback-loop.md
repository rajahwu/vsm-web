# Feedback Loop

## Definition
A Feedback Loop is a corrective cycle that compares outcomes against standards and adjusts behavior accordingly.

## Function
It answers: *How does the system learn?*

Feedback loops close the circle—they take output, measure it, and feed corrections back to the input, creating self-improving systems.

## Operational Use
- Quality assurance checkpoints
- Performance review cycles
- A/B test analysis and iteration
- Customer satisfaction monitoring
- Error detection and auto-correction

Every output should trigger an evaluation that informs the next input.

## Failure Mode
Systems without loops drift until collapse.

Open-loop systems accumulate errors invisibly until catastrophic failure. Without measurement and correction, quality degrades and teams operate blind.
