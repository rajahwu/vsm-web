# Logic Flow

## Definition
Logic Flow is the ordered movement from start to end, mapping how work progresses through a system.

## Function
It answers: *What happens next?*

Logic flow builds sentences from primitives—connecting Dots through Rectangles with Arrows to show the journey from input to output.

## Operational Use
- Client onboarding sequences
- Request-to-delivery pipelines
- Decision trees with branching paths
- Process handoff documentation
- Troubleshooting diagnostic paths

Map the entire flow before optimizing any single step.

## Failure Mode
Broken logic flows create rework and blame.

When steps are unclear or out of order, teams duplicate work, skip critical gates, and ship incomplete solutions.
