# Swimlane

## Definition
A Swimlane assigns **ownership** to process steps by grouping work into horizontal lanes, each controlled by a specific actor or team.

## Function
It answers: *Who owns this work?*

Swimlanes transform generic flows into accountable systems by making responsibility explicit and handoffs visible.

## Operational Use
- Cross-functional workflows (sales → delivery → support)
- Client vs internal team delineation
- Approval chains and escalation paths
- Service provider responsibility mapping
- Identifying bottlenecks at ownership boundaries

Draw lanes before drawing process boxes to force ownership clarity.

## Failure Mode
Unowned steps always fail under pressure.

When work sits between lanes, it becomes "someone else's problem" until the deadline forces panic and blame.
