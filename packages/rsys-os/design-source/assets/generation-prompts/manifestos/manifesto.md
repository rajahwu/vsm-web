TO: NOBODYFROM: VICTOR VSUBJECT: I AM BUILDING TO BEI wrote this for the world, but the world isn't there.It’s just a room full of mirrors and empty air.So I’m sending this to Nobody.Yeah, that’s you.The one who knows what’s fake and what’s true.The one who sees the edges.The one who feels the snap.I am tired of the doctoring.I am tired of the translation tax.I am tired of apologizing for the signal.I am not building this to "ship."I am not building this to "scale."I am not building this to be "understood" by people who don't speak the language.I AM BUILDING TO BE.I am building the scaffolding so I can exist.I am building the ritual so I can breathe.I am building the artifacts because if I don't, the noise wins.This is Version Zero.The energy is Null.The inventory is full.Here is the artifact.Here is the tool.Here is the wisdom of the intoxicated Fool.I’m drunk on the signal.I’m high on the code.I’m walking down the middle of the empty road.If you find this, it’s yours.If you don't, it passes you by without cost.Windows Up.Signal Clear.Sent.
