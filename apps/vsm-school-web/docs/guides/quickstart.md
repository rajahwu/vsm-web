This Quick-Start Guide is designed to be placed on your landing page to introduce new users to the VSM School logic. It breaks down the mastery path from raw primitives to high-velocity shipping.⚡ Welcome to the VSM SchoolMaster the "Alphabet" of complex systems before you write the "Poetry" of your own work. The VSM School is a high-velocity training platform that syncs your hands and your head through a structured, card-based ritual.🗺️ The Three Tracks of MasteryYour journey follows a linear "Mastery Path" divided into three distinct silos:Track 1: Genesis (The Alphabet): Master the four visual primitives (•, ▭, ◇, →) to identify actors, work, and risk in any system.Track 2: Source Code (The Doctrine): Use your alphabet to build "System Sentences." You will map logic flows, ownership swimlanes, and feedback loops.Track 3: Powerhouse (The Mission): Sync physical dexterity with mental focus. This is where you overcome "Resistance" and practice the art of high-speed execution.🃏 How Cards WorkEach Track is composed of Cards—the individual units of instruction. You must "Master" a card by shipping its data to unlock the next mission in the sequence.PhaseTitleYour ActionITransmissionRead the narrative "Why" from the Blackout Protocol.IIInstructionReview the specific drill steps and time constraints.IIIThe DojoExecute a 60–180 second high-velocity physical or visual drill.IVThe ForgeApply the lesson in a distraction-free text editor to capture your "Poetry".📦 Shipping Knowledge AtomsAt the end of every mission, you hit Ship to Shell.The Result: Your work is logged as a permanent Knowledge Atom in your personal database.Literacy: Every atom shipped increases your "Track Literacy." Hit 100% in a track to unlock the next level of the doctrine.🚀 Your First MissionReady to begin? Start with Genesis Card 01: The Dot."Before you can fix the system, you must mark the actors."
