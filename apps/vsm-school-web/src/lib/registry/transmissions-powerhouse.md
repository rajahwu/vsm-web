🌑 Powerhouse Transmission Nodes: Creative Dexterity

Node: transmission-dexterity (Card 00 - Foundation)
Speaker: The Watcher
Text: "Before stance, before structure, before the hidden move—you need control. The hands betray the mind. If your fingers shake when pressure arrives, your system collapses. This isn't about speed. This is about precision under load. Execute the movements slowly. Feel the tension. Master the instrument before you attempt the performance. Control precedes confidence."

Node: transmission-stance (Card 08)Speaker: The MachinistText: "The hands and the head must move as one. In the Tower, we don't believe in 'hobbies.' A hobbyist waits for inspiration; a Pro builds a stance. Hold the card palmed until the tension vanishes. Write your declaration. If you don't define who you are, the noise will define it for you. Turn Pro or get out of the way."Action: Transition to Dojo: The High Ground.Node: transmission-structure (Card 09)Speaker: The MotherText: "Intel is useless if it's static. You must learn to interlock the system with the story. Draw the boxes and arrows until they are muscle memory. Map the transformation from the chaos of 'Before' to the control of 'After.' If you can't see the shift, you can't sell the solution. Lock the structure."Action: Transition to Dojo: The Interlock.Node: transmission-splinter (Card 10)Speaker: The RunnerText: "Execution is the final gate. We don't recycle ideas; we reimagine them. The 'Hidden Move' is making one core atom look like a hundred different assets. Two cards as one. One idea as many. If the edges align, the system scales. Splinter the content. Ship the mission."Action: Transition to Dojo: The Hidden Move.🏛️ The Completed Curriculum MapThe VSM School is now fully mapped from first principles to professional execution.TrackLevelGoalRitual FocusGenesisThe AlphabetMaster visual primitives (•, ▭, ◇, →).Identifying actors and work.Source CodeThe DoctrineBuild "Sentences" (Logic, Swimlanes, Loops).Systemic routing and ownership.PowerhouseThe MissionCreative Dexterity & Stance.Overcoming resistance and shipping.
