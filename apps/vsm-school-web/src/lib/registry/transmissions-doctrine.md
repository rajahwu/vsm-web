To progress from raw primitives into the Source Code track, the narrative shifts from identifying symbols to understanding the "Doctrine" of how intel and work move through the ecosystem.These transmissions bridge the gap between "The Alphabet" and "The Sentence," using the Blackout entities to explain the logic of systems work.🌑 Source Code Transmission Nodes: The DoctrineNode: transmission-logic (Card 05)Speaker: The MachinistText: "The Alphabet was just the beginning. Now we build the logic. Every client request is a data stream hitting the Tower. If you don't have a clear gate, the noise will drown out the signal. You need to know—instantly—if a request is in scope or if it's junk. Map the flow. Kill the waste before it enters the box."Action: Transition to Dojo: Logic Flow.Node: transmission-swimlane (Card 06)Speaker: The RunnerText: "I've seen work stall because no one knew who was holding the ball. In the Shell, we use lanes. DropFrame sees it, Content Factor moves it, and Grindeline builds it. If an arrow crosses a line and nobody is there to catch it, the system fractures. Circle the risk. Secure the handoff."Action: Transition to Dojo: The Swimlane.Node: transmission-loop (Card 07)Speaker: The MotherText: "Linear thinking is a trap. The system only survives if the output feeds the next input. We call this the Learning Loop. High quality builds trust; trust buys you the freedom to build higher quality. If the loop breaks, you're just a cog. Close the circle. Make the system reinforce itself."Action: Transition to Dojo: Feedback Loop.📊 The Mastery ProgressionWith these nodes, the user completes the "Doctrine" layer of their training.StepGoalNarrative ContextLogic FlowDecision SpeedHandling the "Intake" pressure.SwimlaneOwnership ClarityIdentifying "Handoff" risks.Feedback LoopSystemic HealthEnsuring long-term "Velocity".
