# Foundations and Integration, The Comprehensive Guide to Diagrams..., The Systems Work Workbook, and Why Diagram were foundation to the idealization of the VSM School. Ship the first real VSM block

Choose a single Block (for example, “DropFrame Intel Under Pressure”), define one Time Window (e.g., 25 minutes), one Page (one-page React), and 3–4 Cards (drills) that someone could run today.​
Treat that as the reference pattern for all future training. Can we work thought this step

Here is a shippable first VSM Block you can run today, and reuse as the reference pattern going forward.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3]

***

## Block overview

- Block name: **DropFrame Intel Under Pressure**.
- Time Window: **25 minutes** (hard constraint; no phone, no switching contexts).[^1_1]
- Page: **Single React Page** called `IntelUnderPressurePage` with:
    - Timer (25:00 countdown).
    - Three Card panels (A, B, C) visible at once.
    - One “Ship” panel for the learning log at the end.[^1_3][^1_1]

Purpose of this Block: train the DropFrame “tower” to keep intel clear and actionable when the system is under stress, while staying wired into the Radiant Seven doctrine.[^1_3]

***

## Time Window script (25 min)

Use this exact sequence as the ritual:

1. Minute 0–2: Read Block goal and scan the three Cards on the Page.
2. Minute 2–8: Run **Card A**.
3. Minute 8–15: Run **Card B**.
4. Minute 15–22: Run **Card C**.
5. Minute 22–25: Fill the **Ship panel** (learning log) and stop when timer hits zero.[^1_2][^1_1]

***

## Card A – Doctrine snapshot under pressure

- **Front (Scenario)**:
“You are the DropFrame tower. A client’s assets are frozen mid‑project. You have 3 minutes to recall and write the core purpose and roles of the Radiant Seven systems so you can decide what to do next.”[^1_3]
- **Back (Drill)**:

1. In the Page, start a text box: “Radiant Seven under pressure – snapshot.”
2. In 3 minutes, write one short line for each system (Style‑System, DropFrame Studio, Grindline Studio, VSM School, Content Factor, The Shell, The Source) describing:
        - What it governs.
        - How it behaves **when things go wrong**.[^1_3]
3. No editing, no deleting; this is a TUFD-style intel dump.[^1_2]
4. When timer hits 3:00, stop, skim once, and highlight the **single system** that feels most decisive for this scenario.[^1_3]

Outcome: you can surface doctrine fast enough to actually use it in a live intel situation.[^1_3]

***

## Card B – Intel routing map

- **Front (Scenario)**:
“DropFrame picks up an anomaly (client lied / competitor moves in). You have to see the intel path through the ecosystem in under 5 minutes.”[^1_3]
- **Back (Drill)**:

1. On the Page, switch to a simple diagram canvas (or text-as-diagram).
2. Draw or write a **four-node flow**:
        - `DropFrame (eyes & ears)` → `Content Factor (moves intel + Strategic Bolt)` → `Kernel / Shell (control panel)` → `Grindline (hands / execution)`.[^1_3]
3. Under each node, add:
        - One sentence: “What this node *does* with intel under pressure.”
        - One sentence: “What goes wrong here when I’m tired or rushed.”[^1_3]
4. Circle the weakest node today and write one micro‑fix you could train next Block.[^1_3]

Outcome: a concrete, visual route for “intel under pressure” instead of an abstract story.[^1_3]

***

## Card C – TUFD learning log (ship)

- **Front (Scenario)**:
“The 25-minute window is closing. You must ship a knowledge atom, not a ‘perfect’ artifact.”[^1_1][^1_2]
- **Back (Drill)**:

1. Open the Ship panel; title it `learning-log-intel-under-pressure-001`.
2. In **3 minutes**, write:
        - **Subject**: “DropFrame Intel Under Pressure – v0.1 ritual.”
        - **Observation**: 2–3 sentences on:
            - What part of the intel flow felt clearest.
            - Where your brain stalled or scattered.[^1_2][^1_3]
        - **Status**: `READY`.
3. Hit the Page’s “Export” / “Copy as Markdown” and paste into your repo or notes as-is. No cleanup beyond fixing obvious typos.[^1_2]

Outcome: every Block leaves a small, timestamped trail that can be reused as doctrine and future Cards.[^1_2][^1_3]

***

## Using this as the reference pattern

For future Blocks, keep this skeleton and only swap:

- Block name + theme (e.g., “Creative Dexterity,” “Command Line Speed”).[^1_4][^1_1]
- Card fronts (scenarios) and backs (drills), keeping:
    - One doctrine/recall Card.
    - One mapping/diagram Card.
    - One ship/learning-log Card.[^1_4][^1_1][^1_2]

If you like this pattern, next step is to name the exact React components on the Page (Timer, CardGrid, ShipPanel) and wire one concrete export path (e.g., `publish-learning-log` CLI).

# [https://github.com/rajahwu/vsm-web](https://github.com/rajahwu/vsm-web)  we are trying to work out the training pattern This structure creates a clear "Mastery Path." By making the Track the primary container (the page) and the Card the unit of progression, you are building a linear leveling system for the user's brain.

On a mobile device, this feels like a high-stakes card game where each "hand" you play makes you more literate in the system.
📱 The Track-to-Card Architecture
In this model, the "Page" is the vertical silo for a specific doctrine. The user enters a Track, and the interface guides them through a series of "Instructional Atoms" (Cards).

1. The Track: "Genesis" (The Alphabet)
The Goal: Mastering the 4 visual primitives.
Card 01: The Dot ($•$) — Instruction $\rightarrow$ 60s Drill $\rightarrow$ Log.
Card 02: The Rectangle ($\square$) — Instruction $\rightarrow$ 60s Drill $\rightarrow$ Log.
Card 03: The Diamond ($\diamond$) — Instruction $\rightarrow$ 60s Drill $\rightarrow$ Log.
Card 04: The Arrow ($\rightarrow$) — Instruction $\rightarrow$ 60s Drill $\rightarrow$ Log.
Completion: Unlocks the "Source Code" track.
2. The Track: "Source Code" (The Doctrine)
The Goal: Building sentences with the alphabet.
Card 05: Logic Flow (Card A) — Systems-Work Workbook.
Card 06: The Swimlane (Card B) — Ownership \& Risk.
Card 07: Feedback Loop (Card C) — Causal Cycles.
3. The Track: "Powerhouse" (Creative Dexterity)
The Goal: Syncing the hands (Magic/Dexterity) with the head (Writing/Strategy).
Card 08: The High Ground — Palm / Stance.
Card 09: The Interlock — Shuffle / Structure.
Card 10: The Hidden Move — The Glide / Empathy.
🔄 The "Card-Forward" Flow
When a user selects a card within a track, the app initiates the 4-Phase Ritual. On a mobile screen, this is handled via horizontal swipes or a "Next" button at the bottom.
Phase
UI Name
Mobile Interaction
I. Context
Blackout
A narrative "brief" text. Sets the mood.
II. Instruction
The Lesson
The "Source Code" description (e.g., "The Dot is a location").
III. Drill
The Dojo
Flip the card. A 60-second timer starts.
IV. Action
The Forge
A text input area (The Editor) to capture the "Poetry."
🛠️ Data-Driven Progress
Because each Card is its own mission, we can track "Literacy" with extreme precision in Supabase:
User ID: 001
Track: Genesis
Card: 002 (The Rectangle)
Status: Complete
Output: "Atom of work: 'Drafting the email'."
Time: 65 seconds.
This turns the entire "VSM School" into a Progressive Web App (PWA) where the user "levels up" their skills card-by-card.
🎯 Proposed Layout for "Track View"
On the mobile screen, the Track Page would look like this:
TRACK: GENESIS
Status: 25% Literate (1/4 Cards)
[✓] CARD 01: THE DOT
Status: Mastered (Log: 2025-12-18)
[▶] CARD 02: THE RECTANGLE
Target: Process \& Time. (Locked in Dojo)
[ ] CARD 03: THE DIAMOND
Locked: Requires Card 02.
[ ] CARD 04: THE ARROW
Locked: Requires Card 03.
🧪 Brainstorm: Transitioning between Cards
Since you want the flow to be based on a card as the user progresses, how should the app handle the "Success" state?
Manual: User hits "Ship to Shell" and is taken back to the Track list to pick the next card.
Auto-Flow: Shipping a card immediately triggers the Blackout Transmission for the next card in the sequence.
This mobile-first, track-based architecture is much cleaner. By treating the cell phone as the primary workspace, we move away from "pages" and toward "The Mission Flow." The user follows a linear sequence of steps, selecting a Track (The Alphabet, The Doctrine, or The Powerhouse) and executing the Dojo before hitting the Forge.
📱 The Mobile Mission Structure: Step-by-Step
Since we are targeting the cell phone, each step occupies the full viewport. The user moves through these 6 Steps to complete a session:
Step 1: The Pulse (Start)
Interface: A simple, high-contrast time selector.
Action: User picks their window (10m / 25m / 45m).
Vibe: The ritual begins. The phone haptics pulse like a heartbeat.
Step 2: The Transmission (Blackout)
Interface: Narrative scroll/dialogue.
Action: The user reads the instructional lesson (e.g., "The Shell is fractured. Someone is drilling.").
Role: This provides the "Why." It frames the work as a mission.
Step 3: Select Your Track (The Library)
The user chooses which "Doctrine" they are working on today.
Track 1: Genesis (The Alphabet)
Track 2: Source Code (The Sentences)
Track 3: Powerhouse (The Mission)
Focus: Raw Visual Primitives.
Focus: Systems-Work Workbook.
Focus: Creative Dexterity.
Deck Includes:
Deck Includes:
Deck Includes:
• The Dot (Data Point)
▭ VSM Card A (Logic Flow)
🃏 Creative Dexterity
▭ The Rectangle (Process)
▭ VSM Card B (Swimlane)
🏔️ The Iceberg (Depth)
◇ The Diamond (Decision)
▭ VSM Card C (Feedback Loop)
⚔️ War of Art (Resistance)
$\rightarrow$ The Arrow (Cause)
▭ The Locator (Hook)
🏗️ The Tower (Strategy)
Step 4: The Dojo (Conditioning)
Interface: Vertical card-flip simulator.
Action: 60-second high-velocity drill using the card from the selected track.
Vibe: "No polish—just boxes and arrows." The user draws on a scrap of paper or a mobile scratchpad.
Step 5: The Forge (The Editor)
Interface: Full-screen, distraction-free text editor.
Action: The user writes the "Poetry."
Context: A "sticky" reference of the card they just drilled stays at the top of the editor. If they drilled the Swimlane, the editor reminds them: "Map the Handoff Risk."
Step 6: Ship to Shell (The Log)
Interface: Success animation + Data Summary.
Action: Log the "Knowledge Atom" to Supabase.
Result: Progress bars on the Track selection screen (Step 3) update (e.g., "Genesis: 40% Literate").
🛠️ Implementation Strategy: "The Track Registry"
To make this work in the monorepo, we should define a Central Deck Registry. This allows us to add new content (new manuals or workbooks) without changing the UI code.
TypeScript
// Example of how we'd structure the Tracks in the code:
const MISSION_TRACKS = {
genesis: {
title: "The Alphabet",
description: "Pre-Literary Visual Primitives",
cards: ["dot", "rectangle", "diamond", "arrow"]
},
source_code: {
title: "The Doctrine",
description: "Systems-Work Workbook Drills",
cards: ["logic_flow", "swimlane", "feedback_loop"]
},
powerhouse: {
title: "The Powerhouse",
description: "Creative Dexterity \& Strategy",
cards: ["dexterity", "iceberg", "resistance"]
}
}

🧠 Why this works for the Cell Phone
Vertical Focus: Each step is a single screen. No complex sidebars or navigation menus.
Thumb-Driven: Big buttons for "Next Step," card-flipping haptics, and easy track selection.
Context Retention: Because it's a step-by-step flow, the user doesn't get lost. They are always "on mission."
The "Dojo" to "Forge" Pipeline: It forces the user to sync their hands (Dojo) before they are allowed to type (Forge).
This is a foundational shift. You're moving from a "collection of tools" to a Unified Mission Control. By treating the sections as parts of a single-page flow, we create a high-velocity environment where the user never has to "leave" the context of the work.
Here is a brainstorm of how these interfaces consolidate into a single "Master Page" flow, using your "Alphabet" doctrine as the core logic.
🏛️ The Master Page: "The Mission Surface"
Instead of separate routes, imagine a single workspace divided into logical zones that interact in real-time.

1. The Pulse (Tracker) — Header / Aura
Role: The governing rhythm.
Interaction: Not just a timer, but a "State Indicator." When the Tracker is in "Sprint" mode, the UI tightens. When in "Rest," the Editor might dim to encourage stepping away. It sets the background "hum" of the session.
2. The Transmission (Blackout) — The Context Layer
Role: The Narrative Instruction.
Interaction: This lives at the top or as a "Slide-in Brief." Before you master the "Dot," a Blackout node explains why the network is broken.
The Link: Story choices in Blackout could auto-load specific drills into the Training module.
3. The Cipher (Genesis) — The Reference Sidebar
Role: The Pre-Literary Alphabet.
Interaction: A persistent "Cheat Sheet" of your Primitives (•, ▭, ◇, $\rightarrow$).
The Link: As you Master a primitive in Genesis (clicking it off), it "unlocks" more complex cards in the Training deck. It’s the user’s "Literacy Score."
4. The Dojo (Training) — The Warm-up / Sim
Role: Skill Conditioning.
Interaction: This is the "VSM Trainer" card-flip.
The Link: Before the Editor becomes active, the user must "clear" a 60-second drill (e.g., "Draw 10 dots"). It ensures Creative Dexterity—the hands are ready before the brain starts inking.
5. The Forge (The Editor) — The Central Workspace
Role: Text-based Application.
Interaction: A minimalist, markdown-ready writing environment.
The Link: This is where the "Poetry" happens. The "Sentences" (Card A, B, C) are executed here.
Feature Idea: A "Split View" where you write the text on the left, and a "System Scratchpad" on the right allows you to quickly sketch the boxes and arrows.
🔄 The User Flow: "The Daily Protocol"
This is how a user would move through the "One Page" in a single 25-minute session:
Transmission (0-2m): User reads the Blackout Brief. Context: "The Shell is fracturing. Map the Handoff risk."
Calibration (2-5m): Genesis/Training lights up. The user performs "The Swimlane" (Card B) drill on a scrap of paper or a digital pad to warm up the "alphabet."
The Sprint (5-20m): The Editor takes center stage. The user writes the actual content (The "Poetry") using the logic mapped in the previous step. The Tracker pulses in the background.
The Ship (20-25m): The user hits "Ship to Shell." The writing (from Editor) and the session data (from Tracker/Training) are bundled into a Knowledge Atom and sent to Supabase.
🏷️ Rebranding the Sections
If we move to a unified surface, we can name the modules to reflect their "Doctrine" roles rather than their technical ones:
Current Name
Unified Name
Doctrine Role
Blackout Protocol
The Transmission
The "Why" (Instruction)
Genesis Curriculum
The Alphabet
The "Code" (Foundations)
VSM Trainer
The Dojo
The "Reps" (Conditioning)
Ritual Workbook
The Forge
The "Work" (Execution)
Cycle Tracker
The Pulse
The "Ritual" (Rhythm)
🛠️ Integrated UI Concept: "The HUD"
Imagine the Editor as the main canvas.
Left Sidebar: The Alphabet (Genesis icons you can reference).
Right Sidebar: The Dojo (Current Mission Card).
Top Bar: The Pulse (Timer) + Transmission (Narrative snippet).
That clarification reshapes the entire "Ritual" experience. If the Blackout Protocol is the instructional layer and The Editor is the user’s primary workspace for applying those lessons, we are building a "Narrative-to-Production" pipeline.
The user doesn't just "learn" VSM; they play through a scenario (Blackout), practice the physical/mental drills (Trainer), and then execute actual work (The Editor).
🖋️ The Refined Ritual Workflow
The system now functions as a closed loop of learning and execution.
Phase
Component
User Activity
Instruction
Blackout Protocol
Narrative immersion. Learning VSM principles (like "The Watcher" or "The Mother") through branching story choices.
Conditioning
VSM Trainer
Short, high-velocity drills (10/25/45 min) to sync physical dexterity with mental focus.
Execution
The Editor
Distraction-free, text-based writing. This is where the "Ink" happens, guided by the "Plan Before You Ink" philosophy.
🛠️ Architecture for "The Editor" (Ritual Workbook)
Since the Editor is for user-based writing with the content, it needs to be more than just a basic text box. To align with your "Style-System" and "Ritual" principles, we should consider these features:
Integrated Ritual Timer: A subtle version of the RitualCycleTracker (Plan → Sprint → Rest) visible directly in the writing margins.
Content "Atoms" Injection: Since we have the atoms table in Supabase, the Editor could allow users to pull in their training logs or "Genesis" drill notes as reference points while they write.
Minimalist Interface: Following the "Blackout" aesthetic—high contrast, mono-spaced fonts, and zero UI clutter to maximize "Flow State."
Persistence: Auto-saving the writing progress to a user_drafts or workbooks table in Supabase, linked to the user's session.
🌑 Protocol Blackout as the "Lesson"
Using a narrative game for instruction is a brilliant way to handle "Plan Before You Ink." Instead of reading a PDF about "Structure + Clarity," the user might have to help The Machinist repair a "fractured data stream" by making structural choices.
This allows for:
High Retention: Choices made under (narrative) pressure stick better than passive reading.
Lore Integration: The VSM terminology becomes part of the user's vocabulary naturally through the entities (The Watcher, The Runner, etc.).
📈 Implementation Alignment
In light of this, the Migration Plan needs a small tweak:
Blackout: Needs a "Lesson Metadata" layer in the database so we can track which instructional concepts the user has "unlocked" through the story.
Editor: Needs a robust Markdown or Plain Text engine. I recommend using something like Lexical or TipTap within the apps/vsm-school-web to allow for structured writing that still feels "text-base."  --- We are doing that along with the migratrion

The pattern you wrote already matches what the repo is becoming; the missing piece is to **lock it into one canonical data model + one canonical flow** so Blackout, Dojo, Forge, and Atoms all speak the same language.

***

## Master objects to lock

Define three core objects in the app layer and never deviate from them:

- **Track** (the Page / doctrine silo)
    - `id`, `title`, `description`, `cards: CardId[]`, `group: "genesis" | "source_code" | "powerhouse" | ...`.
- **Card** (the Instructional Atom)
    - `id`, `trackId`, `title`, `phases: ["context","instruction","dojo","forge"]`, `lessonRef` (pointer into Blackout or Workbook), `drillSpec` (timer, medium, constraints).
- **Session / Atom payload** (what hits Supabase)
    - `type: "vsm_session"`, `val: { userId, trackId, cardId, phaseDurations, status, outputSummary }`.[^2_1]

All of your flows (Pulse → Transmission → Track → Dojo → Forge → Ship) just become **UI state machines** wrapped around these three objects.

***

## Concrete registry sketch (what to actually code)

Drop this (or a close version) into `packages/ritual` or `apps/vsm-school-web` as your **single source of truth**:

```ts
export type RitualPhase = "context" | "instruction" | "dojo" | "forge"

export type MissionCardId =
  | "dot"
  | "rectangle"
  | "diamond"
  | "arrow"
  | "logic_flow"
  | "swimlane"
  | "feedback_loop"
  | "dexterity"
  | "interlock"
  | "hidden_move"

export type MissionTrackId = "genesis" | "source_code" | "powerhouse"

export interface MissionCard {
  id: MissionCardId
  trackId: MissionTrackId
  title: string
  phases: RitualPhase[]
  lessonRef?: { kind: "blackout" | "workbook"; slug: string }
  drill: {
    seconds: number
    medium: "paper" | "editor" | "mixed"
    prompt: string
  }
}

export interface MissionTrack {
  id: MissionTrackId
  title: string
  description: string
  cards: MissionCardId[]
}

export const MISSION_TRACKS: Record<MissionTrackId, MissionTrack> = {
  genesis: {
    id: "genesis",
    title: "The Alphabet",
    description: "Pre-Literary Visual Primitives",
    cards: ["dot", "rectangle", "diamond", "arrow"],
  },
  source_code: {
    id: "source_code",
    title: "The Doctrine",
    description: "Systems-Work Workbook Drills",
    cards: ["logic_flow", "swimlane", "feedback_loop"],
  },
  powerhouse: {
    id: "powerhouse",
    title: "The Powerhouse",
    description: "Creative Dexterity & Strategy",
    cards: ["dexterity", "interlock", "hidden_move"],
  },
}
```

Then define `MISSION_CARDS` with the actual drills (your dot/rectangle/etc. copy from Daily Visual Alphabet + Systems Work Workbook): [file:842d569a-…]

```ts
export const MISSION_CARDS: Record<MissionCardId, MissionCard> = {
  dot: {
    id: "dot",
    trackId: "genesis",
    title: "The Dot",
    phases: ["context", "instruction", "dojo", "forge"],
    lessonRef: { kind: "workbook", slug: "visual-alphabet.dot" },
    drill: {
      seconds: 60,
      medium: "paper",
      prompt: "Place 20 dots to mark sources, sinks, and watchers.",
    },
  },
  // ...rectangle, diamond, arrow, logic_flow, swimlane, feedback_loop, etc.
}
```

Now **Blackout** just needs to know `lessonRef.slug` to load the right story, and **Editor** just needs `drill.prompt` as sticky context.

***

## One canonical mobile flow

Wire the app to a **single reducer** that walks through the six steps you described, keyed by Track/Card:

1. `PULSE_SELECT`
    - Pick 10 / 25 / 45; create a `sessionId` and open a `vsm_session` draft in memory.[^2_1]
2. `LOAD_TRANSMISSION`
    - From `lessonRef` → load Blackout brief into a full-screen panel.
3. `SELECT_TRACK`
    - Show Track list with percent literate from `atoms` query (`completed cardIds / total`).
4. `RUN_DOJO`
    - Pull `drill.seconds` and start the timer; log `phaseDurations.dojo`.
5. `OPEN_FORGE`
    - Activate the Editor; keep the Card title + drill prompt pinned at the top.
6. `SHIP_TO_SHELL`
    - POST to Supabase `atoms`:

```ts
supabase.from("atoms").insert({
  type: "vsm_session",
  val: {
    userId,
    trackId,
    cardId,
    status: "complete",
    phaseDurations,
    outputSummary,
  },
})
```

Then update local Track progress and either:
        - Auto-flow to next card in `MISSION_TRACKS[trackId].cards`, or
        - Bounce to Track view depending on a simple `autoAdvance` flag in settings.

No extra concepts; everything routes through `trackId`, `cardId`, and a `vsm_session` atom.

***

## How to align with current repo state

Given the README and atoms table:[^2_1]

- Keep **Supabase `public.atoms` exactly as-is**; only standardize the `val` shape for `type = "vsm_session"`.
- Put `MISSION_TRACKS`/`MISSION_CARDS` into `packages/ritual` so:
    - Blackout, Trainer, and Editor all import the same registry.
- In `apps/vsm-school-web`, make a **single “MissionSurface” route** that hosts:
    - Header: Pulse + mini Transmission.
    - Main: Editor (Forge).
    - Right rail / slide-up: Dojo Card.
    - Left rail / drawer: Genesis Alphabet cheat sheet.

```
If you want, the next step can be: “write the exact React component props for `<MissionSurface>` and `<CardRitual>` so you can drop them straight into `vsm-school-web`.”
```

# can you walk through the user flow first

Here is the end‑to‑end user flow, from opening the app on a phone to shipping an atom, using your Track → Card → Phases pattern. [^3_1][^3_2]

***

## 0. Entry point

- User opens the PWA on mobile and taps **“Start Session”** (or a CTA that routes into the Mission Surface instead of `/tracker` or `/training` separately). [^3_1]
- Internally, the app creates a new in‑memory `vsm_session` draft (no Supabase write yet).

***

## 1. The Pulse (Time Window selection)

- Screen: full‑screen, simple options: **10m / 25m / 45m**, plus a start button.
- User taps a duration; the Pulse locks the Time Window and shows “State: Sprint” or similar. [^3_1]
- State now knows: `sessionId`, `timeWindow`, `startedAt`.

***

## 2. The Transmission (Blackout brief)

- Immediately after picking time, user sees a **Blackout story panel** tied to the first Card they will run (e.g., “The Dot” or “Logic Flow”). [^3_1]
- They scroll a short brief: why this mission matters, what is broken, what doctrine is in play.
- At the bottom: big **“Enter Dojo”** button.

***

## 3. Track selection (Library view)

- Next screen lists Tracks with progress bars:
    - **Genesis** – “The Alphabet” – e.g., 25% literate (1/4 Cards).
    - **Source Code** – “The Doctrine”.
    - **Powerhouse** – “Creative Dexterity”. [^3_2][^3_3]
- Each Track expands to show its Cards with states: `[✓]`, `[▶]`, `[ ]` one by one.
- User taps the **next unlocked Card** (e.g., “Card 02: The Rectangle”).

***

## 4. The Dojo (Card drill)

- Screen flips into **Card ritual** for that Track/Card:
    - Phase I – Context: one‑screen reminder (“The Rectangle = a process step. Box every action.”). [^3_2]
    - Phase II – Instruction: short, concrete drill instructions (“Draw 5 rectangles and label real actions you took today.”). [^3_2]
- User taps **“Start Drill”**:
    - Phase III – Dojo: a 60‑second countdown starts; UI tells them to draw on paper or scribble pad, no typing. [^3_2][^3_3]
    - When timer hits zero, the app auto‑advances or shows **“Go to Forge”**.

***

## 5. The Forge (Editor)

- Full‑screen text editor opens with:
    - Card title + drill prompt pinned at the top (e.g., “Use boxes and arrows to explain one system you touched today.”). [^3_2][^3_3]
    - Ritual timer or subtle Pulse indicator still visible.
- User writes a short “poetry” output: reflection, system description, or knowledge atom text.
- When they feel done (or Pulse warns them time is nearly over), they tap **“Ship to Shell”**.

***

## 6. Ship to Shell (Log + Atom write)

- Confirmation screen shows:
    - Track, Card, elapsed time, and a short summary snippet from their editor text.
    - Optional “Tag this Atom” (e.g., `genesis.dot` / `source_code.swimlane`). [^3_4][^3_1]
- On **confirm**, app writes a new row to `public.atoms`:
    - `type: "vsm_session"`
    - `val: { userId, trackId, cardId, timeWindow, durationsByPhase, status: "complete", outputSummary }`. [^3_4]
- After the write succeeds:
    - Track progress updates (e.g., Genesis from 25% → 50%). [^3_1][^3_2]
    - User either:
        - Returns to **Track view** to manually pick next Card, or
        - Is auto‑advanced into the next Card’s Blackout brief, depending on your auto‑flow setting.

***

## 7. Between sessions (Genesis / Tracker routes)

- `/genesis` remains a **curriculum overview**: user can see all 10 drills, check which have Atoms logged, and tap back into any Card. [^3_1]
- `/tracker` stays as a **standalone ritual timer**, but inside the Mission Surface the Pulse is a slimmed‑down version of the same phases (Plan → Sprint → Rest → Reflect → Recover). [^3_1]

If you want, next step can be walking one concrete example: “User runs Genesis → Card 01: Dot” with exact texts and transitions.

# yes let's see that

Here is a concrete, beat‑by‑beat run of **Genesis → Card 01: The Dot** on a phone, using your Track/Card/Phase pattern. [^4_1][^4_2]

***

## Step 1 – Start the session (Pulse)

- User opens VSM School and taps **“Start Session”**.
- Screen shows big buttons: **10m / 25m / 45m**.
- User taps **10m**. The Pulse locks a 10‑minute window and shows “State: Sprint 10:00”.

***

## Step 2 – Transmission for Genesis / Dot

- App loads a **Blackout brief** tied to `trackId = "genesis"`, `cardId = "dot"`:
    - Short paragraph: “The Shell is noisy. You can’t see who is who. Your job is to mark the true actors – the Sources and Clients – before they drown in boxes and arrows.” [^4_2]
- At the bottom, a single button: **“Enter Genesis: The Dot”**.

User taps it.

***

## Step 3 – Track view (Genesis)

- Screen title: **TRACK: GENESIS – The Alphabet**. [^4_2]
- Progress bar: **0% Literate (0/4 Cards)**.
- Card list:
    - `[▶] CARD 01: THE DOT – “Mark the actors.”`
    - `[ ] CARD 02: THE RECTANGLE – Locked.`
    - `[ ] CARD 03: THE DIAMOND – Locked.`
    - `[ ] CARD 04: THE ARROW – Locked.`

User taps **CARD 01: THE DOT**.

***

## Step 4 – Card 01 phases (Context → Instruction → Dojo)

**Phase I – Context (on card)**

- One screen:
    - Title: “The Dot (- )”
    - Copy: “The Dot is a single actor, a specific data point, or a location in space. In Radiant terms, it marks the Source or the Client before they enter the system.” [^4_2]
- Button: **“Show Drill”**.

User taps **Show Drill**.

**Phase II – Instruction**

- Screen shows the drill spec:
    - “You have 60 seconds. On paper, place 10 dots. Each dot = one real actor you dealt with today (a person, a tool, a client). Write a 1‑word label next to each (e.g., ‘Client A’, ‘Figma’, ‘Email’).” [^4_2]
- Button: **“Start 60s Dojo”**.

User taps **Start 60s Dojo**.

**Phase III – Dojo (timer running)**

- Full‑screen dark background, big countdown: **00:60 → 00:00**.
- Instruction pinned at top: “Place 10 dots. Label each with a real actor.”
- User is **not typing**; they’re scribbling on paper.
- At 0, haptic buzz + text: **“Dojo Complete. Go to Forge.”**

User taps **“Go to Forge”**.

***

## Step 5 – Forge (Editor for Dot)

- Screen switches to the Editor:
    - Header strip: `Genesis / The Dot / Session 001`.
    - Pinned hint bar:
        - “Remember: Each dot is a single actor or location. You just marked your real sources and clients.” [^4_2]
- Text area prompt:
    - “In 3–5 sentences, describe what you just drew. Who are the Dots? Which one felt most important under pressure today?”
- Pulse timer shows remaining Time Window (e.g., **6:30** left of the original 10m).

User types a short reflection, for example:
> “I marked 10 dots: 3 clients, 2 tools, 1 teammate, 4 ‘noise’ actors. The main dot is the PM who keeps changing scope…”

When done, user taps **“Ship to Shell”**.

***

## Step 6 – Ship to Shell (Atom write)

- Confirmation screen summarizes:
    - Track: **Genesis**
    - Card: **The Dot**
    - Time: `dojo: 60s`, `forge: 4m`, `window: 10m`
    - Output preview: first 1–2 lines of their text.
- Button: **“Confirm \& Log Atom”**.

On tap, app writes to `public.atoms` in Supabase: [^4_3][^4_1]

```json
{
  "type": "vsm_session",
  "val": {
    "userId": "u-001",
    "trackId": "genesis",
    "cardId": "dot",
    "timeWindow": 600,
    "durationsByPhase": {
      "context": 60,
      "instruction": 30,
      "dojo": 60,
      "forge": 240
    },
    "status": "complete",
    "outputSummary": "I marked 10 dots: 3 clients, 2 tools, 1 teammate..."
  }
}
```

Success message: **“Atom Logged. Genesis +25% Literacy.”**

***

## Step 7 – Return to Genesis track

- App returns to **Genesis Track view**:
    - Progress now: **25% Literate (1/4 Cards)**. [^4_1]
    - Card list:
        - `[✓] CARD 01: THE DOT – Mastered (last log: 2025‑12‑18)`
        - `[▶] CARD 02: THE RECTANGLE – Next: Process & Time.`
        - `[ ] CARD 03: THE DIAMOND – Locked.`
        - `[ ] CARD 04: THE ARROW – Locked.`

From here, user can either end the session or tap into **Rectangle** to repeat the same flow for Card 02.

If you want, next pass can be: “rectangle run” and how it specifically pulls the Logic Flow drill from your workbook into the Dojo.

# yes let's see that

Here is a full run of **Genesis → Card 02: The Rectangle** using your existing drills and the same Dot flow pattern. [^5_1][^5_2]

***

## Step 1 – Back on Genesis track

- After finishing **Card 01: Dot**, the user is on the **Genesis** screen.
- Progress: **25% Literate (1/4 Cards)**. [^5_1]
- Card list now:
    - `[✓] CARD 01: THE DOT – Mastered`
    - `[▶] CARD 02: THE RECTANGLE – “Box the work.”`
    - `[ ] CARD 03: THE DIAMOND – Locked.`
    - `[ ] CARD 04: THE ARROW – Locked.`

User taps **CARD 02: THE RECTANGLE**.

***

## Step 2 – Context phase (Rectangle meaning)

**Phase I – Context**

- Screen shows:
    - Title: “The Rectangle ▭ – The Process Step.”
    - Copy:
        - “The Rectangle is any action that takes time: ‘Write Code’, ‘Send Email’, ‘Render Video’.”
        - “In Radiant terms this is the workhorse of Grindeline – every grind step lives in a box.” [^5_2]
- Button: **“Show Drill”**.

User taps **Show Drill**.

***

## Step 3 – Instruction phase (Logic Flow drill)

**Phase II – Instruction**

- This Card binds to **Drill A: The Logic Flow (The Client Request)**. [^5_2]
- Screen text (adapted for mobile):
    - Goal: “Map a client‑request decision in under 30 seconds.”
    - Steps:

1. Draw **Oval**: “Start”.
2. Arrow to **Rectangle**: “Receive Request”.
3. Arrow to **Diamond**: “Is it in scope?”.
4. If **No** → Rectangle: “Send Rejection Script” → Oval: “End”.
5. If **Yes** → Rectangle: “Log in Notion” → Oval: “End”. [^5_2]
    - Constraint: “You have 30 seconds. No erasing. Just boxes and arrows.”
- Button: **“Start 30s Dojo”**.

User taps **Start 30s Dojo**.

***

## Step 4 – Dojo phase (Rectangle reps)

**Phase III – Dojo**

- Full‑screen timer: **00:30 → 00:00**.
- Pinned drill text at top:
    - “On paper: Start → Receive Request (box) → Is it in scope? (diamond) → Rejection or Log path (boxes) → End.” [^5_2]
- User quickly sketches:
    - Oval → Rectangle → Diamond → two Rectangle branches → Oval.

At 0, haptic + message: **“Dojo Complete. Go to Forge.”**

User taps **“Go to Forge”**.

***

## Step 5 – Forge (Editor for Rectangle / Logic Flow)

**Phase IV – Forge**

- Editor opens with header: `Genesis / Rectangle / Logic Flow`.
- Sticky hint bar summarizes what they just drew:
    - “You just boxed the Client Request flow. Every Rectangle is a grind step; every Diamond is a gate.” [^5_2]
- Prompt in editor:
    - “In 3–7 sentences, explain your flow:
        - What are the **exact boxes** you drew?
        - Where do requests die?
        - Where does real work begin?”
- Pulse shows remaining session time.

User types a brief explanation, e.g.:

> “The flow starts when a client sends a request. Grindeline’s first box is ‘Receive Request’. The gate is ‘Is it in scope?’. If no, we immediately send a rejection script…”

When satisfied, user taps **“Ship to Shell”**.

***

## Step 6 – Ship to Shell (Atom for Rectangle)

- Summary screen:
    - Track: **Genesis**
    - Card: **Rectangle – Logic Flow**
    - Phase times: e.g., context 45s, instruction 30s, dojo 30s, forge 3m.
    - Output preview: first line of their explanation.
- Button: **“Confirm \& Log Atom”**.

App writes another `vsm_session` row in `public.atoms` with `cardId: "rectangle"` and the phase durations/output summary. [^5_3][^5_1]

On success: **“Atom Logged. Genesis 50% Literate.”**

***

## Step 7 – Updated Genesis view

Back on Genesis:

- Progress: **50% Literate (2/4 Cards)**. [^5_1]
- Card list:
    - `[✓] CARD 01: THE DOT – Mastered`
    - `[✓] CARD 02: THE RECTANGLE – Mastered (last log: timestamp)`
    - `[▶] CARD 03: THE DIAMOND – Next: Approval Gates.`
    - `[ ] CARD 04: THE ARROW – Locked.`

From here, user can continue into **Diamond** (binding to your Decision Gate drills) with the exact same four‑phase ritual.

    - “The solid arrow is direct flow: input leading to output.”
    - “Use it to show who hands what to whom – no maybes, no ‘sort ofs’.” [^6_1]
- Button: **“Show Drill”**.


### 3. Instruction phase

- Drill (built from your Daily Protocol: “no polish—just boxes and arrows”): [^6_1]
    - Goal: “See one clear line of work from input to output (with feedback).”
    - Instructions:

1. Write a real **input** at the left (e.g., “Client Brief”, “Raw Footage”).
2. Draw a solid **Arrow →** to a Rectangle: the main process step (“Edit”, “Draft Email”).
3. Draw another **Arrow →** to the **Output** word (“Published Post”, “Final Cut”).
4. Add one curved arrow back from Output to Input labeled “Feedback”.
5. Time limit: 60 seconds. No polish—just boxes and arrows. [^6_1]
- Button: **“Start 60s Dojo”**.


### 4. Dojo phase (Arrow reps)

- Timer: **00:60 → 00:00**, text pinned:
    - “Map one real flow: Input → Process → Output → Feedback.” [^6_1]
- User draws simple arrows and boxes on paper.
- At zero: **“Dojo Complete. Go to Forge.”**


### 5. Forge (Editor for Arrow)

- Editor header: `Genesis / Arrow / Direct Flow`.
- Sticky hint:
    - “Solid arrows are commitments: they say ‘this leads to that’.” [^6_1]
- Prompt:
    - “Write 3–7 sentences:
        - What was your Input?
        - What was the main Process box?
        - What is the Output?
        - How does Feedback change the next Input?”
- User writes, then taps **“Ship to Shell”**.


### 6. Ship + full Genesis completion

- Atom logged with `cardId: "arrow"`.
- Genesis track now shows **100% Literate (4/4 Cards)**:
    - All four Cards marked `[✓]` with last‑log timestamps.
- The app can now trigger an unlock event for the next Track (e.g., **Source Code**) and optionally show a short Transmission: “Alphabet mastered. Source Code track unlocked.”

If you want, next step can be walking the first **Source Code** card (Logic Flow / Swimlane / Feedback Loop) through the exact same four‑phase loop.

<div align="center">⁂</div>

# yes let's see that

Here is how the **Source Code track** can run its first three Cards using the same 4‑phase ritual: Logic Flow, Swimlane, Feedback Loop. [^7_1][^7_2]

***

## Track: Source Code – entry and layout

- After Genesis hits 100% (Dot, Rectangle, Diamond, Arrow), the app unlocks **Track: Source Code – “The Doctrine”**. [^7_1][^7_2]
- Track view on mobile:
    - Status: `0% Literate (0/3 Cards)`
    - Cards:

***

## Card 05 – Logic Flow (Client Request)

### Context

- Title: “Logic Flow – The Client Request.”
- Copy:
    - “You are the tower. Requests hit you all day. This card forces you to see the exact path a request takes from intake to done or dead.” [^7_1][^7_2]
- Button: **“Show Drill”**.


### Instruction

- Drill spec (your existing Logic Flow drill): [^7_1]
    - Goal: Map the decision logic instantly.
    - Scenario: “The Client Request.”
    - Steps:

1. Draw **Oval**: “Start”.
2. Arrow to **Rectangle**: “Receive Request”.
3. Arrow to **Diamond**: “Is it in scope?”.
4. No → **Rectangle**: “Send Rejection Script” → **Oval**: “End”.
5. Yes → **Rectangle**: “Log in Notion” → **Oval**: “End”.
    - Time limit: 30 seconds. No erasing. [^7_1]
- Button: **“Start 30s Dojo”**.


### Dojo

- Timer: **00:30 → 00:00**, pinned text: “Draw Start → Receive Request → Scope gate → Rejection or Log path → End.” [^7_1]
- User sketches the flow on paper; at 0, tap **“Go to Forge”**.


### Forge

- Editor header: `Source Code / Logic Flow / Client Request`.
- Sticky hint:
    - “Every box is a commitment of time. Every diamond is a risk gate.” [^7_1][^7_2]
- Prompt:
    - “Describe this request logic in 5–8 sentences:
        - What happens before the gate?
        - What happens on No?
        - What happens on Yes?
        - Where would you tighten the doctrine?”
- User writes, taps **“Ship to Shell”**, Atom is logged (`trackId: "source_code"`, `cardId: "logic_flow"`), and the Track shows **33% Literate (1/3)**. [^7_3][^7_2]

***

## Card 06 – Swimlane (The Handoff)

### Context

- In Source Code view, user taps **Card 06: Swimlane – The Handoff**.
- Context copy:
    - “The Swimlane shows who owns the ball. If you can’t see the lanes, you can’t see the risk.” [^7_1][^7_2]


### Instruction

- Drill B from your visual drills: [^7_1]
    - Goal: See who owns the ball.
    - Scenario: “The Strategic Bolt” – passing intel from Drop Frame to Grindeline.
    - Steps:

1. Draw 2 horizontal lines (3 lanes).
2. Label: **Drop Frame (Intel)** | **Content Factor (Transport)** | **Grindeline (Build)**.
3. Lane 1: Rectangle “Capture Intel”.
4. Lane 2: Arrow crossing line to Rectangle “Attach Bolt”.
5. Lane 3: Arrow crossing line to Rectangle “Generate Asset”.
6. Circle the line crossings – those are your risk points.
    - Time limit: 60 seconds. [^7_1]
- Button: **“Start 60s Dojo”**.


### Dojo

- Timer: **00:60 → 00:00**, pinned: “Draw three lanes. Capture Intel → Attach Bolt → Generate Asset. Circle the crossings.” [^7_1]
- User sketches; at 0, tap **“Go to Forge”**.


### Forge

- Editor header: `Source Code / Swimlane / Strategic Bolt`.
- Sticky hint:
    - “Where the arrow crosses a lane, ownership changes. That is where work drops.” [^7_1][^7_2]
- Prompt:
    - “In 5–8 sentences:
        - Describe each lane in your org.
        - Describe each handoff.
        - Name the riskiest crossing you circled.
        - One action you could take to harden that handoff.”
- User writes, ships; Atom logged with `cardId: "swimlane"`. Track now **66% Literate (2/3)**. [^7_3][^7_2]

***

## Card 07 – Feedback Loop (The System)

### Context

- User taps **Card 07: Feedback Loop – The Learning Loop**.
- Context copy:
    - “The loop is how the system learns. If the arrows don’t come back, you only ever react – you never adapt.” [^7_1][^7_2]


### Instruction

- Drill C from your visual drills: [^7_1]
    - Goal: See the cycle of adaptation.
    - Scenario: “The Learning Loop.”
    - Steps:

1. Write “Content Quality” (top).
2. Arrow to “Client Trust” (right).
3. Arrow to “Budget/Freedom” (bottom).
4. Arrow back to “Content Quality” (left).
5. Add a “+” in the middle – reinforcing loop.
    - Time limit: 60 seconds.
- Button: **“Start 60s Dojo”**.


### Dojo

- Timer: **00:60**, pinned: “Content Quality → Client Trust → Budget/Freedom → back to Content Quality (+).” [^7_1]
- User draws the loop; at 0, tap **“Go to Forge”**.


### Forge

- Editor header: `Source Code / Feedback Loop / Learning Loop`.
- Sticky hint:
    - “This is a reinforcing loop: quality → trust → freedom → more quality.” [^7_1][^7_2]
- Prompt:
    - “In 5–8 sentences:
        - Where is this loop already alive in your work?
        - Where does it break (which arrow fails)?
        - What is one small change that would strengthen the loop?”
- User writes, ships; Atom logged with `cardId: "feedback_loop"`. Track shows **100% Literate (3/3)** and can trigger unlock of the **Powerhouse** track.

If helpful, next step can be to walk one full **Powerhouse** card (e.g., “The Interlock – shuffle/structure”) through the same pattern so you can confirm that Genesis, Source Code, and Powerhouse all use an identical ritual engine.

    - Skill: **The Box + Arrow**.
    - Drill:
        - “Draw 3 boxes connected by arrows, labeled Input → Process → Output.”
        - “Fill a page with quick flowcharts – focus on speed and clean strokes, not content.” [^8_3]
- Cognitive drill from same card:
    - Concept: **Before and After State**.
    - Task:
        - “Define the Drop Frame transformation in bullets.”
        - Prompt:
            - “Before Drop Frame: describe the client’s pain/chaos.”
            - “After Drop Frame: describe the client’s power/control.”
        - Constraint: bullets only, keep to a one‑page mindset. [^8_3]


### Dojo

- Timer: e.g., **03:00**:
    - First ~90s: pages of **boxes + arrows**.
    - Next ~90s: one clean Input → Process → Output for Drop Frame. [^8_3]
- Pinned: “Boxes = time. Arrows = movement. Make the strokes fast and clean.”


### Forge

- Editor header: `Powerhouse / Interlock / Transformation`.
- Sticky hint:
    - “You just drew the skeleton. Now name the Before/After in words.” [^8_5][^8_3]
- Prompt:
    - “In bullets:
        - Before Drop Frame: 3–5 bullets on chaos.
        - After Drop Frame: 3–5 bullets on control.
        - 1–2 sentences: What part of the flowchart best represents that shift?” [^8_5][^8_3]
- User writes, ships; Atom logged with `cardId: "interlock"`. Track hits **66% Literate (2/3)**.

***

## Card 10 – The Hidden Move (Double Lift / Splinter Effect)

User taps **Card 10: The Hidden Move – Reimagine, Don’t Recycle**.

### Context

- Copy:
    - “The Hidden Move is alignment. Two cards as one, one idea as many assets.” [^8_3]


### Instruction

- Physical drill from Content Rules Card 007: [^8_3]
    - Skill: **The Double Lift**.
    - Drill:
        - “Lift two cards as if they are one. Turn the double over 20 times; it must look like a single sheet.”
- Cognitive drill:
    - Concept: **Reimagine, Don’t Recycle** (Splinter Effect).
    - Task:
        - “Take the Declaration from Card 08. Turn it into:

1. A tweet (≤280 chars).
2. A visual headline for Instagram.
3. A CLI command name.”
        - Constraint: no new ideas, only reformats. [^8_3]


### Dojo

- Timer: e.g., **03:00**:
    - First ~90s: Double Lift reps.
    - Next ~90s: still handling the deck between attempts while thinking about alternate formats. [^8_1][^8_3]


### Forge

- Editor header: `Powerhouse / Hidden Move / Splinter`.
- Sticky hint:
    - “Edges must align. If the idea frays, the illusion breaks.” [^8_3]
- Prompt:
    - Paste or rewrite:
        - Your tweet version.
        - Your IG headline.
        - Your CLI command.
    - Add 2–3 sentences on:
        - “Which format felt most natural to you and why?”

User writes, ships; Atom logged with `cardId: "hidden_move"`. Track shows **100% Literate (3/3)** and Powerhouse is “cleared”.

***

All three Tracks now share one ritual engine:

- Genesis: symbols.
- Source Code: doctrine sentences.
- Powerhouse: dexterity + publishing.

If you want, the next micro‑step can be: choose which of these three Powerhouse cards should be the **default first mission** for new users and adjust the copy to be “day‑one safe” while keeping your same drills.

# can you show the components props

Here are the core component props that line up with the user flow you just designed. [^9_1]

***

## MissionSurface (the master page)

This is the one page that orchestrates Pulse → Transmission → Track → Dojo → Forge → Ship.

```ts
type RitualPhase = "context" | "instruction" | "dojo" | "forge"

interface MissionSurfaceProps {
  userId: string
  // Current selection
  trackId: MissionTrackId | null
  cardId: MissionCardId | null

  // Time window / pulse
  initialDurationSeconds?: number  // e.g. 600, 1500, 2700
  onSessionStart?: (sessionId: string, duration: number) => void
  onSessionComplete?: (atomId: string) => void

  // Data + progress
  tracks: MissionTrack[]                  // from registry / Supabase
  cards: MissionCard[]                    // from registry / Supabase
  completedCards: Set<MissionCardId>      // from atoms or progress table

  // Persistence hooks
  onSelectTrack: (trackId: MissionTrackId) => void
  onSelectCard: (cardId: MissionCardId) => void
  onShipSession: (payload: VsmSessionAtom) => Promise<void>
}
```

`MissionSurface` internally composes the following.

***

## Pulse (timer / session state)

Thin wrapper around your `TrainingEngine` / `RitualCycleTracker`. [^9_1]

```ts
interface PulseProps {
  durationSeconds: number
  onTick?: (remaining: number) => void
  onExpire?: () => void
}
```


***

## TrackSelector

Lists Tracks and Cards with literacy status, and handles selecting the next card.

```ts
interface TrackSelectorProps {
  tracks: MissionTrack[]
  completedCards: Set<MissionCardId>
  onSelectTrack: (trackId: MissionTrackId) => void
  onSelectCard: (trackId: MissionTrackId, cardId: MissionCardId) => void
}
```


***

## CardRitual (Context / Instruction / Dojo wrapper)

This is the “card‑forward” engine per selected card.

```ts
interface CardRitualProps {
  card: MissionCard
  phase: RitualPhase
  timeRemaining?: number

  onPhaseChange: (phase: RitualPhase) => void
  onDojoStart: (seconds: number) => void
  onDojoComplete: () => void
}
```


***

## ForgeEditor (The Editor / Ritual Workbook)

Full‑screen editor, given the current card and session, returns the user’s “poetry” and summary.

```ts
interface ForgeEditorProps {
  card: MissionCard
  sessionId: string
  initialText?: string

  // UI hints
  stickyHint?: string
  remainingSeconds?: number

  // Called when user taps “Ship to Shell”
  onShip: (draft: {
    text: string
    outputSummary: string
  }) => void
}
```


***

## StoryPlayer (Transmission / Blackout)

You already have this split as `StoryEngine` + `StoryPlayer`. [^9_1]

```ts
interface StoryPlayerProps {
  storyId: string
  cardId?: MissionCardId        // to load the right brief for this card
  onComplete: (ending: string) => void
}
```


***

## TrainingSession (low‑level timer + card UI)

This sits underneath `CardRitual` for the Dojo phase. [^9_1]

```ts
interface TrainingSessionProps {
  block: TrainingBlock        // can be derived from Track + Card
  duration: number            // seconds for dojo
  onComplete: (stats: SessionStats) => void
}
```

With these props, you can mount:

- `<MissionSurface>` on `/training` or a new `/mission` route,
- Have it import existing `StoryPlayer`, `TrainingSession`, and your new `ForgeEditor`, all wired to Supabase via the `onShipSession` callback that writes the `vsm_session` atom. [^9_1][^9_2]

# Evaluate the app, lesson, flow and plan so far and give some suggestions

The app, lesson design, and migration plan are already strong and coherent; the main work now is unifying them around a single “mission surface,” tightening data models, and smoothing first‑time UX. [^10_1][^10_2]

***

## What is working well

- Architecture is solid: Next 14 app router, shadcn, Supabase atoms, and clear separation between engines (`TrainingEngine`, `StoryEngine`) and UI components. [^10_1]
- Routes cover all core functions: landing, cycle tracker, Genesis curriculum, narrative Blackout, and VSM Trainer with real atom logging. [^10_1]
- Lesson content is grounded in a tight visual alphabet (Dot, Rectangle, Diamond, Arrow) and three core drills (Logic Flow, Swimlane, Feedback Loop), which map cleanly into the Source Code track. [^10_2][^10_3]
- Powerhouse cards (War of Art, 1‑Page Marketing Plan, Content Rules) tie creative dexterity directly into shipping and transformation, which matches your “Here → Media” doctrine. [^10_4][^10_5]

***

## Gaps and friction points

- Fragmented experience: `/tracker`, `/genesis`, `/blackout`, `/training`, and future `/editor` are powerful but feel like separate tools, not one continuous ritual. [^10_1]
- Editor route is still missing, so the “Forge” phase exists conceptually but not as a concrete workspace tied to atoms. [^10_1]
- Genesis progress is currently checklist‑based; the mission flow you just defined (Track → Card → 4 Phases → Atom) is not yet the primary interaction pattern. [^10_1]
- Protocol Blackout is rich but not yet wired as the canonical “Transmission” phase per card/track; it runs as its own game. [^10_1]

***

## Suggested changes to the app

1. **Introduce a single Mission route (or surface)**
    - Add `/mission` (or repurpose `/training`) that mounts `MissionSurface` and orchestrates:
        - Pulse (time window)
        - Blackout / StoryPlayer for context
        - TrackSelector (Genesis / Source Code / Powerhouse)
        - CardRitual (context/instruction/dojo)
        - ForgeEditor (editor)
        - Ship to Shell (atom write)
    - Keep `/genesis`, `/tracker`, `/blackout` as “labs” and overviews, but make `/mission` the default training entry. [^10_1]
2. **Lock in the Track / Card registry as shared data**
    - Centralize `MISSION_TRACKS` and `MISSION_CARDS` in a package (e.g., `@rsys-os/data-client` or `@gttm/ritual-components`) so:
        - VSM Trainer, Genesis, and MissionSurface read the same definitions.
        - Protocol Blackout can resolve story nodes per `cardId` instead of hardcoded. [^10_1][^10_2]
3. **Finish the Editor as “Forge” instead of a generic page**
    - Implement `/editor` as `ForgeEditor` driven by:
        - `trackId`, `cardId`, `sessionId`, and a sticky card hint.
        - `onShip` writing `vsm_session` atoms with `outputSummary`. [^10_1][^10_6]
    - Optionally mount the same component inside `/mission` so `/editor` is just a deep‑link into Forge.

***

## Suggested changes to the lesson / flow

1. **Make Genesis mandatory onramp**
    - For first‑time users, only show **Genesis** in TrackSelector until at least **Dot + Rectangle** are logged once. [^10_2]
    - This ensures users have the visual alphabet before touching Source Code or Powerhouse content.
2. **Standardize the 4‑phase Card template**
    - For every card in all tracks, enforce:
        - Context: 1–2 short sentences.
        - Instruction: numbered drill steps + time limit.
        - Dojo: single timer and one clear action (“draw”, “shuffle”, “map”).
        - Forge: 3–8 sentence or bullet prompt that always ends with one “ship‑ready” snippet (summary, tweet, or bullet list). [^10_2][^10_5]
    - Store this structure in the Card definition so UI stays dumb and generic.
3. **Tie Blackout to specific doctrine, not just lore**
    - For Genesis and Source Code cards, add a small `lessonRef` that maps to Blackout story nodes:
        - E.g., `lessonRef: { kind: "blackout", slug: "shell-fracture.dot" }`. [^10_1]
    - Keep Protocol Blackout playable as a standalone story, but let MissionSurface request a short “brief node” matching the active card.

***

## Suggested changes to the migration / infra plan

1. **Prioritize data‑driven curriculum before expanding features**
    - Implement `genesis_drills`, `tracks`, `cards` tables (or similar) and plug the existing Genesis page into Supabase via `useCurriculum()` and `useUserProgress()`, as your plan already sketches. [^10_1]
    - This will let you add and reorder cards without code changes.
2. **Add minimal auth + per‑user atoms**
    - Wire in Supabase Auth (even email‑magic‑link only) so `atoms` and `user_genesis_progress` are scoped per user. [^10_1]
    - This unlocks real “literacy” tracking and meaningful percentages on TrackSelector.
3. **Implement feature flags around MissionSurface**
    - Use the `FEATURES` object you already defined (e.g., `USE_DATABASE_TRAINING`, `USE_MISSION_SURFACE`) to:
        - Keep current `/training` path stable.
        - Gradually move users onto the new mission‑based flow once it’s tested. [^10_1]

***

## Short tactical next steps

- Implement `MissionSurface` and wire it to existing `StoryPlayer`, `TrainingSession`, and a first version of `ForgeEditor`. [^10_1]
- Move the Genesis 4‑card Dot/Rectangle/Diamond/Arrow track into the registry and run one full “Genesis → Dot” session end‑to‑end on live Supabase. [^10_2]
- Add `/editor/page.tsx` that simply mounts `ForgeEditor` with URL params (track/card/session) so you can deep‑link into the Forge from logs or admin tools. [^10_1]

That will convert what is currently an excellent collection of tools into a single, legible training machine that matches the doctrine and the mobile mission flow you outlined.
